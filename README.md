**Intro:**
I am Sikder Qais, or Qais as my friends call me, I am a Private Investor/Business Owner based out of NYC, New York. Prior to 2020, I was a Cybersecurity professional and manager. I was the right-hand man to many CISOs in large financial institutions helping them navigate Application Security, Threat & Vulnerability Management, and the ever-evolving Cybersecurity regulatory landscape. I was also a former PwC-US consulting financial institutions on their Cybersecurity. You can find my resume here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sikder-qais-283b5728/

I got involved in the Polkdot ecosystem in 2020. My first parachain auction was Acala and Astar. But, I got involved with OpenGov in February 2024. Initially, I had very little interest in participating in OpenGov. However, I started getting more involved after I started noticing OpenGov abuse in April of this year. I consider myself one of the retail Polkadot community’s voices against OpenGov abuse.

I go by many names in this ecosystem:
I go by Fossil112 on OpenGov:

Political Philosophy:
My political philosophy is very simple. I want to Make Polkadot a Market Leader Again! I will pursue this goal regardless if I lose my bid for Decentralized Voices. Here are my methods for making Polkadot a market leader again!:

Stop OpenGov Abuse: My first goal is to stop OpenGov abuse. Abusing OpenGov hurts retail investors’ confidence in the ecosystem and the reputation of Polkadot overall.
I want to introduce the concept of an Ethics Board. This board is responsible for keeping OpenGov ethical. The Ethics Board will consist of 7 members hand-picked by the Technical Fellowship, Parity, and Web 3 Foundation. They can also remove any members of the Ethics Board anytime should they deem any of the members have been compromised. The Polkadot community can also whistle-blow to the Technical Fellowship, Parity, or the Web 3 Foundation should they believe any of the members have been compromised. A wish for change can also be used to add or remove members of the Ethics Board as needed by the community.

The Ethics Board should have the power to cancel any refs on OpenGov with a majority vote of 4/7 should they deem them unethical, corrupt, or abusive to the Polkadot Ecosystem.

The Ethics Board should also review and vote on large treasury spending consisting of greater than USD 100,000. I am proposing that a 4/7 vote should be accomplished first for any tracks asking for a large treasury spend before the community votes on it in OpenGov. This will force any large spend in OpenGov to take ethics into account. This can also stop large spend spamming and abuse as we saw with refs: 
Ref 684: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/684
Ref 785: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/785
Ref 1065: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/1065

Shift OpenGov to a Value-Centric Approach: What do I mean by a value-centric approach? I mean all refs that ask for treasury funding must provide an equivalent or higher value to Polkadot than the proposed funding after the ref is completed.

Marketing Bounties: I am only interested in the Conversion metric. I don’t care about how many Impressions we generate with our branding, or how many Engagements our Key Opinion Leaders (KOL) generate. Marketing Conversions metrics include:
Institutional/Retail Polkadot Investors introduced to Polkadot
New programmers/developers introduced and converted to PBA attendees, POP, Plaza, JAM, and Parachains/Partnerchains developers
New Parachains/Partnerchains introduced to Polkadot because of marketing

ROI-Centric Approach to OpenGov: What I want to see is a return-on-investment-centric approach to all spending in OpenGov. This means after every spend a Debrief/After-Action-Report should be generated to determine the efficacy of each ref based on spend. These reports should include money spent, ROI-rating, the efficacy of the ref, a rating of the services rendered, and lessons learned. We should refrain from rewarding Polkadot actors who have a history of delivering low-quality or suspect services.

A Community-Centric Approach to Polkadot America: I think Web3/Parity has done an amazing job at creating Polkadot communities in Europe and Asia. But, I think we should shift our attention to America (the world’s wealthiest country). I co-founded Eagle DAO to give Americans a voice in the Polkadot ecosystem. This isn’t an official DAO, there aren’t any multi-sig wallets associated yet, and it won’t be ready by DV Cohort 3. But, it is a community of Polkadot Americans that are passionate about Polkadot. We discuss refs, and potential future refs here:
You can join Eagle DAO here: https://t.co/OInDfelUOE
My future goal is to expand the Polkadot American community based on cities and states as Polkadot chapters to further Polkadot-related initiatives in the US:
The chapters will focus on Polkadot-related funnels:
A funnel for introducing Polkadot-related products to Americans such as Polkadot Pay, Nova Wallet, etc.
A funnel for inviting and educating institutional and retail American investors into Polkadot.
A funnel for developers/programmers to build Dapps/Appchains in Polkadot via POP and Plaza etc.
A funnel for developers/programmers to build Parachains in Polkadot by introducing them to the Polkadot SDK/PBA etc.

Why Chose Me As DV:
I will always fight OpenGov abuse, corruption, and conflicts of interest.
I will keep track of and report on high-risk OpenGov refs (Key Risk Indicators, KRIs) and share them with other DVs, Technical Fellowship, Parity, W3F, the Polkadot community, or anyone else as requested. I have created similar reports for the C-Suite when I worked for the big banks.
I will vote on, and provide feedback on every OpenGov ref.
I will attend every AAG, you can already see me saying GM at the start of every AAG for the last 3 months or so on the chat.

Past Accomplishments:
I have always fought against OpenGov abuse, corruption, and conflicts of interest since April 2024:

A certain memecoin founder had promised the Polkadot community a 100% supply airdrop of his memecoin to Polkadot holders. He also took over 100,000 DOT (Over a million USD) from the Polkadot treasury by March, when DOT was priced at about 10 dollars each. Then he airdropped only 5% to the community without community approval, and no one can explain what happened to the other 95% of the supply.
The Kusamarian’s report on this potential treasury misappropriation/abuse: https://x.com/GldnCalf/status/1771248100402700738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1771248100402700738%7Ctwgr%5E6ef5ca96b7ae9d2b4f459f117825c346fff45760%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2F1bl76d6%2F%3Fresponsive%3Dtrueis_nightmode%3Dtrue

Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/Polkadot/comments/1ble5s5/what_will_happen_to_ded/
The same meme coin founder threatened to sue certain members of the Polkadot community for harassment when they tried to call him out on his abuse.
I fought against the inclusion of DED in official marketing initiatives:
https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/834#8wSV5Lt9XFSbRTZ54CNq
https://x.com/SikderQais/status/1805718414700298368


The same memecoin founder started Polkadot's Head Ambassador(HA) program. Many of his HA aspirants were also applying for the DV position simultaneously. The DV program was first, and they started it seemed like they were engaging in quid-pro-quo relationships. You can see many of the DVs were called out by the community when they were supporting his meme coin here: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/834#8wSV5Lt9XFSbRTZ54CNq
I took things a step further, questioning the whole program's efficacy and requesting transparency for the HA program: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/912
Sad to say my ref was canceled, and I was shunned by many people in the Polkadot community for questioning the HA program.
I whistle-blowed about the HA program to the Technical Fellowship. After a thorough investigation by the Technical Fellowship, they found Michiko Watanabe to be a ghost ambassador. From what I understand, the whole HA program has been stopped and has been revamped with the help of Shawn Tabrizi.

A certain report was released by Tommi Enenkel about OpenGov marketing spending. But, it was @DefiIgnas who made the excessive spending popular to the Polkadot community, and the community was outraged against the same memecoin founder: https://x.com/DefiIgnas/status/1807784567241351286
The memecoin founder was asking for a 500,000 DOT refill of his marketing bounty.
So I fought against this refill with the help of the Polkadot community (Part 1): https://x.com/SikderQais/status/1815073284012098007

Part 3: https://www.reddit.com/r/Polkadot/comments/1e8saa5/giottos_ref_920_is_about_to_pass_refill_for/

Chainalysis was spamming and abusing OpenGov with the help of their rich friends. Originally, the Defi guy fought them. Then they went to the Root Track and were canceled by the community. Then they came back with their 3rd proposal. They did not care about the community feedback. They just pretended to care. So I fought against their 3rd ref as well.
